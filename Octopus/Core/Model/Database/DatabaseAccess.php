# DatabaseAccess does:
#	- establish a connection to the database using credentials set in the config.
#	- reference this (and only this single one) connection to any entities that need to perform database operations.
#	- provide a simple interface to perform database operations (essentially a PDO wrapper).
#	- let the controller disable the database connection for all entities by a single function call.
#
# Every database request in Octopus should be executed using only this class. It works the same as using PDO the usual
# way, with being different only that this class takes over the creation of the PDOStatement or denies it if the
# DatabaseAccess has been disabled.
#
# Why does the database access need to be disabled at some point at all?
# Database requests are mostly used by the Entity and Relationship classes. Requests by these classes should
# only be performed BEFORE outputting results in templates began. Or formally, db requests should only be performed
# while the Endpoints's execute() function is running. Allowing templates to trigger requests themselves (and thus
# potentially alter the database) contradicts the idea of a consistent, well-ordered program flow and would be an
# uncontrollable risk.
# Therefore, the database access should be disabled centrally before any objects are being passed on to the templates.
# This is accomplished by calling the disable() function of this class. As there exists only one instance that is
# referenced to all objects needing it, calling disable() effects all these objects. Any request to open a PDO is then
# rejected by this classesâ€™ prepare() function.
# Important: This is not an invincible safety feature. It is still possible for templates to create their own
# connections. This functionality only makes such code looking a little more ugly in order to try to prevent smart
# developers having stupid ideas.
