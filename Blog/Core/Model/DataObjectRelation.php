# What is a DataObjectRelation?
# A DataObjectRelation is a construct used to create and store many-to-many relations between two classes of DataObjects.
# To illustrate: Imagine you have a blog with some articles about various topics. What you might want to do is to
# categorize them by their topic, so that your readers can search by category and find your articles more easily.
# To each category, you might also want to write a little introductory text.
# So now you need to have two tables in your Database (and two respective subclasses of DataObject):
# Articles (with i.e. a title, the author's name and content) and Categories (with a name and an introduction).
# The difficulty is that each article should be able to have multiple categories and (obviously) each category can
# include multiple articles. This construct is called a many-to-many relationship.
# To store this in the database, you not only need the two object tables, but also a junction table containing a
# list of all existing relations between these objects (search for "many-to-many relation" for detailed explainations).
# So each instance of this class constitutes a relation between two objects. Its data is stored as a row in the
# junction table.
# This class is an abstract class, so for every pair of dataobject classes related to each other, there has to be
# a separate 'concrete' child class of this containing details (for the two classes Category and Article, there might
# be a class ArticleCategoryRelation).
# Every concrete subclass of this has to define two private properties for the DataObjects related to each other, so
# i.e. the class ArticleCategoryRelation would have the following properties:
#	protected ?Article $article;
#	protected ?Category $category;
# Each instance of DataObjectRelation also gets an unique, randomly-generated id (works and looks the same as
# the id of a DataObject and has the same function).
# It is possible to define other properties, just as for concrete DataObjects. These properties, however, can only be
# of the type 'primitive'.


abstract class DataObjectRelation {
	public string $id;
	# public ?[child of DataObject] $[name of 1st object];
	# public ?[child of DataObject] $[name of 2nd object];
	# ...other properties

	# this constant defines whether multiple relations of the same pair of DataObjects should be allowed to exist
	const UNIQUE; # true = forbidden; false = allowed

	# this defines which two DataObject classes the relation consists of
	const OBJECTS = [
		# '[name of 1st object]' => [child of DataObject]::class,
		# '[name of 2nd object]' => [child of DataObject]::class
	];
